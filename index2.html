      <p>The lack of African history has been an excuse used by historians since the beginning of colonization. The idea that Europeas saved Africa from savagery was still the widely held belief until later parts of the 19th century. Because a large majority of ideas and structures in
        the United States are rooted in racism and an over appreciation of European ideals and values, the definition of history itself is problematic. Supposedly, history begins with writing, and because Europeans brought writing to Africa, their presence is the beginning of African history.
        Though this may not be as widely believed in our current society, our school systems are still being taught as if oral and documentary sources couldn’t produce respectable African history.<br></p>

          <p>Young students aren’t being taught a curriculum that values telling the dark truths of US history. Many of them are actually open to learning the real history of black people in and outside of the United States, but that’s often not an option for them. Without even being told that
             the history they’re learning is inaccurate, students from all ethnic backgrounds and racial groups fail to understand how and why the US, as well as countries abroad, work the way they do today. <br></p>

            <p>There are endless stories about black people. We experience the same things that other people do too. We all live needing and experiencing the human condition. There’s more to us than pain and suffering and torture and black history is bigger than European colonization. It’s
              unfortunate that schools failed to make teaching this a priority, while white history was at the forefront of everything we were exposed to in school.<br></p>
