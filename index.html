        <p>Black history is a topic often discussed with a certain level of discomfort. I grew up in places where I was often the only black person in a classroom. When the topic of black history would be brought up, eyes would scan the room, pinning me down in my seat. I’d bow my head or look away in discomfort. The next week,
          sometimes the next class, everything would be back to normal. The focus on the suffering of black people at the hands of Europeans would be over.<br></p>

          <p>We’d discuss black history starting with the transatlantic slave trade in the 16th century and ending with the civil rights movemet in the 1960s, as if that’s where racism ended. For years, I lived with the belief, even as a black child, that all black people had to offer the world, in terms of a robust history,
            was their suffering. The problem can be summed up quite frankly: black history is only important in the context of white people. Black history can only be taught if it’s interwoven with the complex and controversial history of a number of European nations. Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Italy ravaged the
            continent of Africa and left it in religious, economic, and social shambles, yet even when talking about black pain we focus on the cause more than the effects. When we do focus on the effects, there’s more empathy awarded to those who were doing the major harm as opposed to those who had to endure it. “How has Europe changed?”, they say.
            “Should Great Britain be responsible for paying reparations? Is it fair to still place blame on these European countries if it's ‘no longer happening’?”<br></p>

            <p> We learn a watered down version of slavery, attempting to make the US sound far kinder than it was, then neglect to include the history of black people beyond the pain. We don’t learn about black joy, love and invention (unless they were ‘the first black person in the US to do xyz’). I learned almost nothing, in all my years of education,
               about Africa before the introduction of white Europeans. We learned about the medieval period in Europe, the Roman Empire, Mesopotamia and Babylonia, but almost nothing about the nations of Africa when they were independent.<br></p>
